      <b>Description of the Visualization: </b>The visualization aims to predict whether the variation of temperature is high in Phoenix. Some people adapt to places with high climatic variations quickly, but some do not. So, knowing about climatic variations is vital before settling in a country. I chose a dataset that had “High Temperature” of every day and their respective “Date” from May to Sep 2020.
     </p> 
     <p>
      I would like to take a stand on this by giving a Statement.<br>
      <b>Statement:</b>
      “Variation of temperature is less in Phoenix.”
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>Left Chart: </b>In the left chart, I plotted the line graph of Temperature vs. Date to visualize the temperature trend in Phoenix. The rhetorical technique I used is “Truncating y-axis.” I scaled the y-axis from 80-120°F to deceive the viewers about the temperature trend in Phoenix. This chart concludes that temperature variation is high in Phoenix.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>Right Chart: </b>In the right chart, I plotted the line graph of Temperature vs. Date again. But this time, I used the rhetorical technique of “Extending y-axis”. I scaled the y-axis from 0-400°F to make the viewers recognize that temperature variation is less in Phoenix. This chart concludes that temperature variation is less in Phoenix.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>Conclusion: </b>The left chart opposes my statement, whereas the right chart supports my statement. My statement is true because temperature variation is less in Phoenix. Phoenix is basically like a desert, so the temperature is high all the time.
